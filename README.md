# 👋 Hi, I'm **Abdul-Rahman Ajidagba**  

### 📊 Data Science and Machine Learning Enthusiast

##  About Me  
I am passionate about **Data Science and AI** — from exploring datasets in Jupyter notebooks to building models that solve real-world problems.  
My focus is on **End-to-End Machine Learning and AI**: training models, and deploying them so they can be used outside the notebook.
